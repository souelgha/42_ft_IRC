pour le parsing
  Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
   (OPTIONAL), the command, and the command parameters (maximum of
   fifteen (15)).  The prefix, command, and all parameters are separated
   by one ASCII space character (0x20) each.
   
   ASCII colon character (':', 0x3b), which MUST be the first character of the
   message itself.  There MUST be NO gap (whitespace) between the colon
   and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
   origin of the message. 
   these messages SHALL NOT exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
   the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
   for the command and its parameters. 

  source          ::=  <servername> / ( <nickname> [ "!" <user> ] [ "@" <host> ] )
  nick            ::=  <any characters except NUL, CR, LF, chantype character, and SPACE> <possibly empty sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, and SPACE>
  user            ::=  <sequence of any characters except NUL, CR, LF, and SPACE>

  command         ::=  letter* / 3digit
